#### üå† tl;dr
It's like a [Factory Pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/factory-method-design-pattern) for arbitrary sequences of data manipulation. You can think of it like [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for computation.

## üî• Features
  - Deeply configurable, user-extensible function definitions.
    - Design arbitrarily long sequences of data manipulation.
    - Define multiple routes based on [`type-check`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-check) rigorous declaration syntax.
  - Optional persistent middleware state.
    - You can cache and respond to middleware results from previous executions.
  - Synchronous execution, independent of middleware asynchrony. (yes, _really_)
    - If you're tired of `async`/`await` or `.then()`, you [don't have to use them at all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deasync).
  - A friendly interface. üëã
    - If you know [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html), then you know rippleware.
    - Intuitive indexing enables simple operation on deeply-nested propagated data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Using [`npm`]():

```bash
npm install --save rippleware
```

Using [`yarn`]():

```bash
yarn add rippleware
```

##  Overview

### 1. Hello, world!

The only entity that is exported from rippleware is `compose`, which we can `use()` to define each step in our function:

```javascript
import compose from 'rippleware';

const app = compose()
  .use(handle => handle('*', () => "Hello, world!")); // handle('*', () => Promise.resolve("Hello, world!")) would behave identically
  
  //.use().use().use()...

console.log(app()); // "Hello, world!"
```

Let's break this down. When make a call to use, we're expected to pass a `Function` that accepts a single argument, `handle`, which is used to define all of the routes for that step in your middleware based upon the input data shape. Here, we use the asterisk (`*`) to accept any data whatsoever. Therefore, when we make a call to `app()` with undefined arguments, rippleware routes the data successfully to the handler.

It's important to note that your handler functions can operate _asynchronously_ via [`Promises`](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) or [`async`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)functions, the result will still return synchronously.

> For a detailed look at the capabilities of routing strings, check out [type-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-check).

**Note**:
If you'd prefer, you can opt out of synchronous behaviour by passing `{ sync: false }` to your call to `compose()`.

### 2. Routing

You can make multiple calls to `handle` within a single middleware; these define the different operations that can be performed based upon the shape of the input data. Since each handler is compared against in the order they were defined, care should be taken to ensure that multiple handler allocations should use increasingly generalized checkers.

```javascript
import compose from 'rippleware';

const app = compose()
  .use(
    (handle) => {
      handle('[String]', () => "You passed a string!");
      handle('*', () => "You didn't pass a string!");
    },
  );

console.log(app('This is a string.')) // "You passed a string!"
console.log(app({ life: 42 })) // "You didn't pass a string!"
```

You don't have to define routes just based on strict type checking. You can just as easily define a **matcher function**:

```javascript
const app = compose()
  .use(
    (handle) => {
      handle(input => (typeof input === 'string'), () => "You passed a string!");
      handle(input => (typeof input !== 'string'), () => "You didn't pass a string!");
    },
  );
```

If a valid route is not found, the incompatible `.use()` stage will throw and prevent subsequent stages from being executed for the active invocation.

### 3. Indexing

It is also possible to define a specific interest in processing and returning only a subset of return data.

```javascript
import compose from 'rippleware';

const addOneToANumber = () => handle => handle("Number", n => n + 1);

const app = compose()
  .use([addOneToANumber()]);
  
console.log(app([2])); // 3
```

Notice that we pass an array `[2]` into our `app`, but because we use indexing on the middleware definition, it only operates on the first element of the input data. This is how we retrieve a scalar result.

### 4. State

Finally, it's possible to use state inside of your middleware functions. This can be used for a number of different applications, most commonly caching. In the example below, we will always try to return the first result of execution, if it is exists. 

```javascript
import compose from 'rippleware';

const app = compose()
    .use(handle => handle('*', (next, last) => (last || next)));

app('The only value this will ever return.'); // "The only value this will ever return."
app('Some other value')); // "The only value this will ever return."
```

At the first execution of your middleware, the value of `last` will be `undefined`. For all subsequent executions, the value of `last` will be equal to whatever your middleware returned the last time it was called. In addition, `last` is [immutable](https://medium.zenika.com/immutability-in-javascript-7e1a19b45615) to prevent misuse.
